StrideSync firebase functions for Senior Design Project

### Setup/installation
1. Create a virtual environment and install all requirements inside of `requirements.txt`
```bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Important Note**: Ensure your virtual environment is called `venv`, NOT the typical `.venv`. The firebase emulator will not recognize the virtual environment with the latter name.
